# Psychic-Game
Guess what letter the computer is thinking!

This is a simple web app programmed with jQuery. The user has 9 tries to guess the correct letter the computer is thinking. If the user fails to guess with in 9 tries, they get a loss recorded and the game resets. However, if they guess correctly, then the user gets a point, the computer loses, and the game resets.
